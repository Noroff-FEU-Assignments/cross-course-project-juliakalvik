      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would advise the client to use https, which is a version of http but
      with encryption and verification. This makes https a more secure
      alternative than http. I would also recommand to implement automatic user
      timeout, which basically means that the website automatically resets or
      empties the user's activity, such as automatically logging out after a
      certain amount of time, or emptying the user's cart after for example a
      month of inactivity.
